In this challenge, we were requried to creat a coding quiz to test our peers on their knowledge of various coding topics. I began by creating the HTML and javascript, using an array for the questions, along with various functions to enable the quiz to flow properly. 

Also, unlike a normal quiz, in this quiz you are scored by how much time you had left on the timer when you finsihed the quiz. For example, if you finished the quiz with 15 seconds left, then you are left with a final score of 15. 

Additionally, each time a user selects a wrong answer, they are docked 5 seconds of their remaining time. This incentivizes answering the question correctly on the first try. Check it out with the link below, and good luck!
